 * So far, functionality includes allowing a user to view live music events organized and filtered in various ways,

// # 'Reservster' is a project I was encouraged to build during my web development classes at Startup Institute; 
// # I have used the creation of this restaurant reservation web app as an exercise to apply skills I learned in class, 
// # and to pursue further learning as I’ve added additional features. 
// # The app enables log in by two different types of users: restaurant owners, who must log in to add restaurants and can only 
// # edit their own restaurants, and customers, who must log in to make reservations and can only edit their own reservations. 
// # Each reservation is associated with both the customer who created it and the restaurant it is made at. 
// # Here in the reservations controller, you can see the definition of the different ‘CRUD’ actions for reservations 
// # (‘create, read, update, and delete’) and related functions, including authentication and authorization of customers. 
// # The identity is tracked of not only the individual reservations, but also of the customer who creates the reservation, 
// # and of the restaurant from which the customer initiates the creation of a reservation.
// # This app is a work in progress; potential future plans include specifying reservation indexes by customer and by restaurant, 
// # as well as adding and enhancing various styling, interactivity, and validation features and writing tests to run.
